# CN_MealsApp
This is my Meals App created using HTML, CSS and JS.

I've tried to develop this application using HTML, CSS and JS only. Developed this in the pattern and background colors same as currently active online food apps like Swiggy and Zomato (just an inspiration to use those colors).

As I'm still learning the frontEnd developement I've used internet resources as well to develop it and I can say I mainly depended on the internet resources only.
I'm still trying to learn more in FrontEnd and in FullStack Developement. Hope I'll master it in the future.
